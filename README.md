# PYTHON-TRANSLATOR
Simple, but powerfull translator using Python and googletrans lib


### Creating a simple translator in Python
* Creating a simple translator in Python can be an interesting project. We can use the translate or googletrans library, which works with the Google Translate API. In this concept, we will create a basic translator that will translate text from one language to another.

Here's an example of implementing a translator in Python using the googletrans library. 

### Steps to implement:
1. Install the googletrans library.
2. Write the code to translate the text.

### Installing the library
First, install the `googletrans` library:
  `pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1`


### Additional settings
`You can change the default source and target languages in the translate_text function.
You can also expand the functionality by adding support for other libraries or APIs for text translation.
This example represents a basic implementation of a translator. Depending on the requirements, you can add additional features and improvements.`
